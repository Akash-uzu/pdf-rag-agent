Maybe I do know and just don’t want to admit it to myself\nI don’t even know what to call it—this thing I’m writing. It feels a little\npretentious to call it a diary. It’s not like I have anything to say. Anne Frank\nkept a diary—not someone like me. Calling it a “journal” sounds too\nacademic, somehow. As if I should write in it every day, and I don’t want to\n—if it becomes a chore, I’ll never keep it up.\nMaybe I’ll call it nothing. An unnamed something that I occasionally write\nin. I like that better. Once you name something, it stops you seeing the\nwhole of it, or why it matters. You focus on the word, which is just the tiniest\npart, really, the tip of an iceberg. I’ve never been that comfortable with\nwords—I always think in pictures, express myself with images—so I’d never\nhave started writing this if it weren’t for Gabriel.\nI’ve been feeling depressed lately, about a few things. I thought I was doing\na good job of hiding it, but he noticed—of course he did, he notices\neverything. He asked how the painting was going—I said it wasn’t. He got\nme a glass of wine, and I sat at the kitchen table while he cooked.\nI like watching Gabriel move around the kitchen. He’s a graceful cook—\nelegant, balletic, organized. Unlike me.

I’ll try it.”\n“Don’t just say it, darling. Do it.”\n“I will.”\nHe kept nagging me, but I did nothing about it. And then a few days later he\npresented me with this little book to write in.

I feel better already—writing this down is\nproviding a kind of release, an outlet, a space to express myself.

And if I’m\ngoing to be honest—and I may as well be—the real reason I agreed to keep\nthis diary was to reassure him—prove that I’m okay. I can’t bear the\nthought of him worrying about me.

They were both artists—Alicia\nwas a painter, and Gabriel was a well-known fashion photographer. He had\na distinctive style, shooting semi-starved, semi-naked women in strange,\nunflattering angles. Since his death, the price of his photographs has\nincreased astronomically. I find his stuff rather slick and shallow, to be\nhonest. It has none of the visceral quality of Alicia’s best work. I don’t\nknow enough about art to say whether Alicia Berenson will stand the test of\ntime as a painter. Her talent will always be overshadowed by her notoriety,\nso it’s hard to be objective. And you might well accuse me of being biased.\nAll I can offer is my opinion, for what it’s worth. And to me, Alicia was a\nkind of genius. Apart from her technical skill, her paintings have an\nuncanny ability to grab your attention—by the throat, almost—and hold it\nin a viselike grip.\nGabriel Berenson was murdered six years ago. He was forty-four years\nold. He was killed on the twenty-fifth of August—it was an unusually hot\nsummer, you may remember, with some of the highest temperatures ever\nrecorded.

The house was in pitch-black darkness; none\nof the light switches worked. The officers made their way along the hallway\nand into the living room.

A love story of the saddest kind.\nAlcestis willingly sacrifices her life for that of her husband, Admetus, dying\nin his place when no one else will.

Eventually,\nI found myself at the front of the line—and was confronted with the\nAlcestis.\nI stared at the painting, staring into Alicia’s face, trying to interpret the\nlook in her eyes, trying to understand—but the portrait defied me. Alicia\nstared back at me—a blank mask—unreadable, impenetrable. I could divine\nneither innocence nor guilt in her expression.\nOther people found her easier to read.\n“Pure evil,” whispered the woman behind me.\n“Isn’t she?” her companion agreed. “Cold-blooded bitch.”\nA little unfair, I thought—considering Alicia’s guilt had yet to be\nproven.

A sphinx.\nDuring the trial, the judge took a dim view of Alicia’s persistent refusal\nto speak. Innocent people, Mr. Justice Alverstone pointed out, tended to\nproclaim their innocence loudly—and often. Alicia not only remained\nsilent, but she showed no visible signs of remorse. She didn’t cry once\nthroughout the trial—a fact made much of in the press—her face remaining\nunmoved, cold. Frozen.\nThe defense had little choice but to enter a plea of diminished\nresponsibility: Alicia had a long history of mental health problems, it was\nclaimed, dating back to her childhood. The judge dismissed a lot of this as\nhearsay—but in the end he allowed himself to be swayed by Lazarus\nDiomedes, professor of forensic psychiatry at Imperial College, and clinical\ndirector of the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London. Professor\nDiomedes argued that Alicia’s refusal to speak was in itself evidence of\nprofound psychological distress—and she should be sentenced accordingly.\nThis was a rather roundabout way of saying something that psychiatrists\ndon’t like putting bluntly:\nDiomedes was saying Alicia was mad.\nIt was the only explanation that made any sense: Why else tie up the\nman you loved to a chair and shoot him in the face at close range? And then\nexpress no remorse, give no explanation, not even speak? She must be mad.","metadata":{"chapterNumber":1,"chapterTitle":"Section 1","chunkIndex":14,"totalChunksInChapter":453,"globalChunkIndex":14,"source":"thesilentpatient.pdf","previousChapter":null,"nextChapter":null,"preview":"At the time, I remember thinking that while everyone was talking, writing, arguing, about Alicia, at"}},{"pageContent":"don’t like putting bluntly:\nDiomedes was saying Alicia was mad.\nIt was the only explanation that made any sense: Why else tie up the\nman you loved to a chair and shoot him in the face at close range?

It snowed heavily in London that\nDecember, and the whole of our garden was buried beneath a crisp thick\nwhite carpet. Mum and I made a snowman. Unconsciously or not, we built\nhim to represent our absent master: I christened him Dad, and with his big\nbelly, two black stones for eyes, and two slanting twigs for stern eyebrows,\nthe resemblance was uncanny. We completed the illusion by giving him my\nfather’s gloves, hat, and umbrella. Then we pelted him violently with\nsnowballs, giggling like naughty children.\nThere was a heavy snowstorm that night. My mother went to bed and I\npretended to sleep, then I snuck out to the garden and stood under the\nfalling snow. I held my hands outstretched, catching snowflakes, watching\nthem vanish on my fingertips. It felt joyous and frustrating and spoke to\nsome truth I couldn’t express; my vocabulary was too limited, my words\ntoo loose a net in which to catch it. Somehow grasping at vanishing\nsnowflakes is like grasping at happiness: an act of possession that instantly\ngives way to nothing.

A patient\ndelegates his unacceptable feelings to his therapist; and she holds\neverything he is afraid to feel, and she feels it for him. Then, ever so slowly,\nshe feeds his feelings back to him. As Ruth fed mine back to me.\nWe continued seeing each other for several years, Ruth and I. She\nremained the one constant in my life. Through her, I internalized a new kind\nof relationship with another human being: one based on mutual respect,\nhonesty, and kindness—not recrimination, anger, and violence. I slowly\nstarted to feel differently inside about myself—less empty, more capable of\nfeeling, less afraid.

It smelled different from the rest of the\nhospital. It didn’t smell like antiseptic or bleach; rather bizarrely, it smelled\nlike an orchestra pit. It smelled of wood, strings and bows, polish, and wax.\nIt took a moment for my eyes to become accustomed to the gloom, then I\nnoticed the upright piano against the wall, an incongruous object in a\nhospital. Twenty-odd metallic music stands gleamed in the shadows, and a\nstack of sheet music was piled high on a table, an unsteady paper tower\nreaching for the sky. A violin was on another table, next to an oboe, and a\nflute. And beside it, a harp—a huge thing with a beautiful wooden frame\nand a shower of strings.\nI stared at it all openmouthed.\nDiomedes laughed. “You’re wondering about the instruments?” He sat\nbehind his desk, chuckling.\n“Are they yours?”\n“They are.

When she was first admitted, Alicia slashed her\nwrists twice and self-harmed with whatever she could get her hands on. She\nwas kept on two-on-one observation for the first six months—meaning two\nnurses watched over her at all times—which was eventually relaxed to one-\non-one. Alicia made no effort to interact with patients or staff, remaining\nwithdrawn and isolated and for the most part, the other patients had left her\nalone.

I offered him the packet.\nYuri shook his head. “I don’t smoke. Not cigarettes, anyway.” He\nlaughed. “You look like you need a drink. Come on, I’ll buy you a pint.”\nI hesitated. My instinct was to refuse—I had never been one for\nsocializing with work colleagues. And I doubted Yuri and I had much in\ncommon. But he probably knew Alicia better than anyone else at the Grove\n—and his insights might prove useful.\n“Sure,” I said. “Why not?”\nWe went to a pub near the station, the Slaughtered Lamb. Dark and\ndingy, it had seen better days; so had the old men dozing over their half-\nfinished pints. Yuri got us a couple of beers, and we sat at a table at the\nback.\nYuri took a long swig of beer and wiped his mouth. “Well? Tell me\nabout Alicia.”\n“Alicia?”\n“How did you find her?”\n“I’m not sure I did find her.”\nYuri gave me a quizzical look, then smiled. “She doesn’t want to be\nfound? Yeah, it’s true.

I’ve not been there\nin years, not since Gabriel and I went together one afternoon in search of\nhis lost youth.

They’d turn up at\nthe market in the early morning and watch the traders set up their stalls\nand try and score some grass from the Rastafarian dealers hanging out on\nthe bridge by Camden Lock. The dealers were no longer there when Gabriel\nand I went—to Gabriel’s dismay. “I don’t recognize it here anymore,” he\nsaid. “It’s a sanitized tourist trap.”\nWalking around today, I wondered if the problem wasn’t that the market had\nchanged as the fact Gabriel had changed. It’s still populated by sixteen-\nyear-olds, embracing the sunshine, sprawled on either side of the canal, a\njumble of bodies—boys in rolled-up shorts with bare chests, girls in bikinis\nor bras—skin everywhere, burning, reddening flesh.

For some reason I\ncouldn’t stop thinking about the homeless man. Apart from pity, there was\nanother feeling, unnamable somehow—a kind of fear. I pictured him as a\nbaby in his mother’s arms. Did she ever imagine her baby would end up\ncrazy, dirty and stinking, huddled on the pavement, muttering obscenities?\nI thought of my mother. Was she crazy? Is that why she did it? Why she\nstrapped me into the passenger seat of her yellow mini and sped us toward\nthat redbrick wall? I always liked that car, its cheerful canary yellow. The\nsame yellow as in my paint box. Now I hate that color—every time I use it, I\nthink of death.\nWhy did she do it? I suppose I’ll never know. I used to think it was suicide.\nNow I think it was attempted murder.

But the truth is he’s a deeply romantic man—in his heart if\nnot his speech. Actions speak louder than words, don’t they? And Gabriel’s\nactions make me feel totally loved.\n“Where do you want to go?” I asked.\n“Three guesses.”\n“Augusto’s?”\n“Got it in one.”\nAugusto’s is our local Italian restaurant, just down the road. It’s nothing\nspecial, but it’s our home from home, and we’ve spent many happy evenings\nthere. We went around eight o’clock. The air-conditioning wasn’t working,\nso we sat by the open window in the hot, still, humid air and drank chilled\ndry white wine. I felt quite drunk by the end, and we laughed a lot, at\nnothing, really. We kissed outside the restaurant and had sex when we came\nhome.\nThankfully, Gabriel has come around to the portable fan, at least when\nwe’re in bed.

A reservoir of ice.\nI had been seeing Ruth for a long time before I met Kathy, and I\ncontinued therapy for the first three years of our relationship.

Gabriel was sitting on a fence in a country field, his\nhair blowing in the breeze, a camera slung around his neck. He looked more\nlike an actor than a photographer. Or an actor playing a photographer.\nMax caught me looking at the picture and nodded as if reading my\nmind. “My brother got the hair and the looks. I got the brains.” Max\nlaughed. “I’m joking. Actually, I was adopted. We weren’t blood related.”\n“I didn’t know that. Were you both adopted?”\n“No, just me. Our parents thought they couldn’t have children. But after\nthey adopted me, they conceived a child of their own soon after. It’s quite\ncommon apparently. Something to do with relieving stress.”\n“Were you and Gabriel close?”\n“Closer than most. Though he took center stage, of course. I was rather\novershadowed by him.”\n“Why was that?”\n“Well, it was difficult not to be.

Totally normal.”\n“And Alicia?”\n“Normal.” He shrugged. “Maybe a bit more jumpy than usual, but…”\n“But?”\n“Nothing.”\nI sensed there was more. I waited.\nAnd after a moment, Max went on, “I don’t know how much you know\nabout their relationship.”\n“Only what I read in the papers.”\n“And what did you read?”\n“That they were happy.”\n“Happy?” Max smiled coldly. “Oh, they were happy.

We\ndrank champagne and ate small sweet tomatoes with smoked salmon and\nslivers of bread. Somewhere, in the back of my mind, was a vague feeling of\nfamiliarity, a nagging sense of déjà vu I couldn’t quite place. Perhaps it was\nsimply a recollection of childhood stories, fairy tales, and magical trees\nbeing gateways to other worlds. Perhaps it was something more prosaic.\nAnd then the memory came back to me:\nI saw myself when very young, sitting under the branches of the willow tree\nin our garden in Cambridge. I’d spend hours hiding there. I may not have\nbeen a happy child, but during the time I spent under the willow tree, I felt a\nsimilar contentment to lying here with Gabriel.

I felt glad to be out of London—\nthe sky was less oppressive, and I could breathe more easily.\nI left the train along with a trickle of students and tourists, using the map\non my phone to guide me. The streets were quiet; I could hear my footsteps\non the pavement echoing. Abruptly the road stopped. A wasteland lay\nahead, muddy earth and grass leading to the river.\nOnly one house stood alone by the river. Obstinate and imposing, like a\nlarge red brick thrust into the mud. It was ugly, a Victorian monster. The\nwalls were overgrown with ivy, and the garden had been overtaken by\nplants, weeds mostly. I got the sense of nature encroaching, reclaiming\nterritory that had once been hers. This was the house where Alicia had been\nborn. It was where she spent the first eighteen years of her life. Within these\nwalls her personality had been formed: the roots of her adult life, all causes\nand subsequent choices, were buried here.

Then I turned and looked.\nThe moment I saw the painting, I let out an involuntary laugh.\nThe subject was Alicia’s aunt, Lydia Rose. It was obvious why she had\nbeen so upset by it. Lydia was nude, reclining on a tiny bed. The bed was\nbuckling under her weight. She was enormously, monstrously fat—an\nexplosion of flesh spilling over the bed and hitting the floor and spreading\nacross the room, rippling and folding like waves of gray custard.\n“Jesus.

Not exactly a page-turner. An odd play.\nThe hero, Admetus, is condemned to death by the Fates. But thanks to\nApollo’s negotiating, he is offered a loophole—Admetus can escape death\nif he can persuade someone else to die for him. He asks his mother and\nfather to die in his place, and they refuse in no uncertain terms. It’s hard to\nknow what to make of Admetus. Not exactly heroic behavior, and the\nancient Greeks must have thought him a bit of a twit. Alcestis is made of\nstronger stuff—she steps forward and volunteers to die for her husband.\nPerhaps she doesn’t expect Admetus to accept her offer—but he does, and\nAlcestis dies and departs for Hades.\nIt doesn’t end there, though. There is a happy ending, of sorts, a deus ex\nmachina. Heracles seizes Alcestis from Hades and brings her triumphantly\nback to the land of the living. She comes alive again.

When he saw me by the\nwindow and realized I’d been up all night, he went quiet and started acting\nstrange.\n“Alicia, sit down. We need to talk.”\n“Yes. We do need to talk. About the fact that you don’t believe me.”\n“I believe that you believe it.”\n“That’s not the same thing. I’m not a fucking idiot.”\n“I never said you were an idiot.”\n“Then what are you saying?”\nI thought we were about to get into a fight, so I was taken aback by what\nGabriel said.

You’re not here!”\nHe looked so tired, so upset. I wanted to protect him. I wanted to comfort\nhim. “It’s okay, darling,” I said. “It’s going to be okay, you’ll see.”\nGabriel shook his head, like he didn’t believe me. “I’m going to make an\nappointment with Dr. West. As soon as he can see you. Today if possible.”\nHe hesitated and looked at me. “Okay?”\nGabriel held out his hand for mine—I wanted to slap it away or scratch it.
